 <h1>How to stay safe from COVID-19?</h1>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Wash your hands with soap and water</dt><br>
  <dd>Wash your hands as often as possible. Wet your hands with warm water, then apply a mild soap. Work the soap into a lather for 20-30 seconds, then rinse your hands clean under warm running water. The World Health Organization recommends not just rubbing your hands palm to palm, but interlacing and interlocking your fingers in a variety of different ways to make sure every surface is clean. If you can't wash your hands, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol. Alcohol percentages higher than 95% are actually less effective.</dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth.</dt><br>
  <dd>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth in case the virus is on your skin.  If you need to touch your face, wash your hands first so you’re less likely to infect yourself.</dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing</dt><br>
    <dd>Since coronavirus is a respiratory infection, coughing and sneezing are common symptoms. Additionally, coughing and sneezing both release the virus into the air, so they may increase your risk of infection. Keep your distance from people who appear to have symptoms of an upper respiratory infection.</dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Don’t shake hands with people, whether they show symptoms or not.</dt><br>
    <dd>Unfortunately, people who are infected with coronavirus may spread the illness even if they aren’t showing symptoms.</dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Try not to worry too much if you're not truly at risk. </dt><br>
    <dd>Myths about coronavirus have spread on social media, sometimes causing unnecessary fear. Get the facts about coronavirus from a reliable source like the Center for Disease Control (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, it's helpful to fact-check your sources before making any decisions.</dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Wear disposable protective gear while providing care for a sick person.</dt><br>
    <dd>Put on disposable gloves, a face mask, and a paper gown before you care for the sick person. When you leave their room, take off your protective gear and throw it in a plastic trash bag. Don’t reuse your protective clothing because you may accidentally come into contact with the virus.</dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
  <dt>Don’t share household items with the infected person. </dt>
	<dd>Coronavirus can linger on items like cups, plates, utensils, and towels. Use separate items for each member of the household while someone is sick. Otherwise, you might accidentally spread the infection.</dd>
